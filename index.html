  <p> Hey! I'm Victoria, a 23 year old ex-National Geographic Photographer. Over the last 5 years I have had the privledge to work along side National Geographic to Capture moments across the world within my favourite braches of Photograhy. My main focus of photography within my last 5 years has been mountains, landscape, the sky and flowers. </p>
  <p> Since decideing to leave national geographic I took up another passion of teahcing in Southern Ontario. Starting off with a small studio in Lindsay, Ontario has recently expanded to two other locations in Peterborough and Oshawa. These three studios foster an environment of learning and creativity. </p>
