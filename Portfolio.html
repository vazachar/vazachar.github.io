<h2>Landscape Photography</h2>
<img src="images1/img9004tree.jpg" alt="Landscape">
<p>My favourite form of photography; Landsacpe. Taken in Algonquin park. I think we can all agree camping is a superior way to live.</p>

<h2>Cloud Photography</h2>
<img src="images1/img5978cloud.jpg" alt="Cloud">
<p>I used to imagine clouds like this were distant avalanche's and I was on a quest to escape it. Questionably considered landscape photography, however it brings me so much joy that I dedicate it to a category of itself.</p>
